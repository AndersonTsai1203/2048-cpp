# 2048 Like Game

a simple version of 2048 Game Movement Implementation

## Background

a 2048 game-like grid system where cells contain hexadecimal string values, and movements (up, down, left, right) are processed by a function that moves and merges the data in the grid. The program mimics the mechanics of the game 2048, with merging logic increasing the value of adjacent cells if they contain the same value.
